Exercise 1 - UFO Shooting
In Exercise 1, your goal is to develop timing skills and hand-eye coordination. A UFO will bounce back and forth at the top of the screen, and when you press the SPACE key, a projectile will shoot. The objective is to hit the enemy UFO at the bottom of the screen as many times as possible. If you miss three times, you lose.

Use the SPACE key to shoot projectiles.
Watch the UFO's movement and time your shots.
Keep an eye on your lives and score at the bottom of the screen.
If you lose, you can choose to try again or quit.
